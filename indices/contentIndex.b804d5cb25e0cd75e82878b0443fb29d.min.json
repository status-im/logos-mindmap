An open source project built and operated entirely by its community. It’s intended to exist peacefully alongside our existing economies and states. \n\nA continuation of the original cypherpunk movement advocating for the widespread use of strong cryptography and technologies that enhance privacy and self-sovereignty. \n\nA complete infrastructure stack - with modular protocols for communication, file storage, and smart contracts. But at its core, Logos is a grassroots movement unified in our belief in protecting human rights and defending against tyranny through technology. \n\nA movement to create a self-sovereign crypto network: a decentralised technology stack that maximises the cost of surveillance and coercion while minimising the cost of exit, voice and loyalty. \n\n\nThe world's first crypto-state.\n```\n\n\u003e**\"We build everything on top of consensus.\"**\nDr. Corey Petty\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\nis to provide a \"[[Living Database]]\" with a [[hierarchy of information]] displayed using fun [[cooking motifs]] to deliver:\n\n1.
