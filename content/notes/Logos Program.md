Logos is

A parallel socioeconomic system that empowers individuals and communities worldwide. An open source project built and operated entirely by its community. Itâ€™s intended to exist peacefully alongside our existing economies and states. 

A continuation of the original cypherpunk movement advocating for the widespread use of strong cryptography and technologies that enhance privacy and self-sovereignty. 

A complete infrastructure stack - with modular protocols for communication, file storage, and smart contracts. But at its core, Logos is a grassroots movement unified in our belief in protecting human rights and defending against tyranny through technology. 

A movement to create a self-sovereign crypto network: a decentralised technology stack that maximises the cost of surveillance and coercion while minimising the cost of exit, voice and loyalty. 


The world's first crypto-state.
